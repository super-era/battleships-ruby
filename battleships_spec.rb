# planning
# ------------------
# need to check if the board is the correct size and generates the correct number of ships in a permitted arrangement (horizontal/vertical)
# if a player misses a ship with their attack, then the board will not change but the miss will show up in the version printed to the console
# there needs to be at least one blank square between each ship; no ships may touch
